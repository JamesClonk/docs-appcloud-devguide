title: Two-Factor Authentication
---

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

If you enable Passeport's two-factor authentication, you have to use the `--sso` flag and follow the instructions.

<pre class="terminal">
cf login -a <%=vars.api_endpoint%> --sso
API endpoint: <%=vars.api_endpoint%>

One Time Code ( <%=vars.api_endpoint%>/passcode )>
</pre>

Switching to the browser and obtaining a one time code is needed because the cf CLI does not support two-factor auth directly from the terminal yet.
